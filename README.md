WNV_Methods_Outbreak_Manuscript

This repository contains the bioinformatic pipelines + necessary files (reference genomes, .bed files, etc.) needed to generate WNV genomes using the IDT xGen WNV assay described in the manuscript here:

You will also find the sample metadata for each WNV genome generated in this study (Sample_Metadata.csv) and the .fasta files for the paired genomes used to validate the WNV IDT xGen WNV assay shown in Figure 2 (WNV_Genomes_IDT_PS_Comp.fasta)

All .fasta files for the WNV genomes generated as a part of this study have been uploaded to NCBI () and Pathoplexus ()
